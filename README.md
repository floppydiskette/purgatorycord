## info

feel free to contribute or fork, hell if you're even more insane you could even daily drive this theme like i do!

like many amazing ideas, this entire theme was inspired by this one scene from death note

## goals
all updates and contributions to this theme should follow these goals
- messages should remain somewhat readable
- everything should only be implemented in css
- no external resources should be linked (local resources may be used in the future, but i'm still unsure)
